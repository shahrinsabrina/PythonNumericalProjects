# PythonNumericalProjects

A collection of Python-based numerical simulations and computational physics projects demonstrating applied methods in simulations, numerical integration, and visualization.


## Projects

**1. Simulation of Planetary Motion Using Euler Method**

Simulates a planet orbiting a star under Newtonian gravity using the Euler method. Visualizes the orbital path and demonstrates numerical error accumulation over time.

**2. Analysis of How an Object Orients in 3D Space**  
Simulates the rotation of a rigid 3D object (cube) using rotation matrices, Euler angles, and quaternions. Includes plots of angles/quaternions and an animated 3D rotation.

**3. Calculating Ground State Energy of Harmonic Oscillator (Variational Quantum Monte Carlo)**  
Uses a variational Monte Carlo method to estimate the ground state energy of a 1D harmonic oscillator. Computes local energy for a trial wavefunction and finds the optimal variational parameter.

**4. Damped Driven Pendulum Simulation**  
Simulates the dynamics of a damped and driven pendulum using numerical integration (Euler/Runge-Kutta). Visualizes periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic motion.
