# RK4 Pendulum Simulation

This project simulates the motion of a damped and driven pendulum using the Fourth Order Runge-Kutta method.  

**Highlights:**
- Solves two coupled differential equations (dθ/dt = ω, dω/dt = bcos(ω₀t) - qω - sinθ)
- Uses Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib
- Plots angular displacement and velocity over time

**How to run:** Open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.
