## Projects Included

### 1. Simulation of Planetary Motion Using Euler Method
**Objective:**  
Simulate the motion of a planet orbiting a star using the Euler method, visualizing the orbit and understanding the limitations of this numerical approach.  

**Description:**  
- Implements Newtonian gravity to compute accelerations.  
- Updates position and velocity of the planet stepwise using the Euler method.  
- Visualizes the orbital path of the planet around the star.  

**Python Files/Notebook:**  
- `Planetary_Motion_Euler.ipynb`  

**Dependencies:**  
```bash
numpy
matplotlib
